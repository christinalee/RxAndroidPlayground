# RxAndroidPlayground

A shell app for Android engineers to experiment with reactive streams without needing to wait out build times for larger production apps. 

The app has examples in both Kotlin and Java, for both Rx1 and Rx2 (although the original playground was set up for Rx1 and thus the direct translations to Rx2 leave something to be desired).
